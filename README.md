# Welcome to the `dev` branch!

Please merge all branches to be pushed to our dev bucket like this:

- `git checkout dev`
- `git merge <name-of-branch>`

This should trigger the GitHub Action workflow. If not, try `git push` to the dev branch.

## Collaboration

Every time you pull this repo to work on it, remember to run `npm install` first so you have the latest dependencies!

**Please remember to create separate branches for new features, and to pull from `master` before pushing.**

### Tips on React components

- Components live in `src/components`
- You need to have `import React from 'react';` at the top of every component page
- Formatting is very strict, so it may be easier to copy and paste old components into new component files, and modify from there.

## ESLint

Run ESLint from the terminal with `npm run lint`

ES Lint has been configured. If you find a rule you want to implement, please inform the group before implementing.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
