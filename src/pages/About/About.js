                <p>
                    According to the Literacy Trust, over <strong>380,000</strong> children in the UK do not own a single book, with disadvantaged children less likely than their peers to own a book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Children who own books are six times more likely to read above the expected level for their age (22% vs 3.6%), and nearly three times more likely to enjoy reading (56.2% vs 18.4%).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hundreds of thousands of children are missing out.</strong>

                    The BookClub connects individuals to organisations (charities, schools, libraries, publishers, etc) that are offering free books to children with no books of their own.
